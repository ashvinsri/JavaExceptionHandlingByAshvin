Exception Handling:-
First of all What is Exception?????
Exception is the abnormal condition arises in the function. Suppose you have written a function to fetch data from London... Ok
Now after execution of the function ur server contacted london database but Unfortunately !! data was not present there got it.....
so what will happen????? 
this is called (File not Found Exception) so program will be terminated at runtime and all ur further functionalities will be effected and u will be unknown to this error ....
so to handle this we use the faadu concept of Exception handling....
By using Exceptional handling we simply write the handler code so that if some abnormalities occurs in the program then handler can handle it


try 
{

///////There are chances of Exception Here
}
catch(Exception Name)
{

    /// Handler which handles the exception and gives u message 
}
